## What I'm about
I am a  Systems Design Engineer with experience in software engineering, data science, and product management. I thrive off of projects that put me out of my comfort zone and follow agile development. I'm inspired by Machine Learning, Signal Processing, Data Science, and Optimization.

Send me a note if you want to work on a project together!
