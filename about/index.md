## What I'm about
Data driven Product Manager with 6+ years of practical experience in product development, data science, and software engineering. From new product launches at startups, to products launched that serve over a million daily active users, I’ve become adept at reducing communication complexity and increasing clarity while acting as the interface between cross-functional engineering, sales, and marketing teams. I’m on a mission to build features and products users love, whose data is integral in shaping and realising a grand vision.

I'm always interested in new projects. Send me a note if you want to chat.
